👋 Hi, I’m @Dagudelot

I am a Software Engineer with 4 years of experience and currently a Tests Automation Engineer at Choucair Testing 🧑🏼‍💻

I like adding value in multiple areas of technology like coding, databases, UI design, cloud architectures and a lot of other technologies around software development, but I love delivering quality and that's why I am a tester

I learn something new everyday and I am constantly developing side-projects, I consider myself to be a very curious person to stay in only one field 😄

I made the Test Automation with Cypress course on Choucair Academy.
In a near future I am going to speak on Tech Conferences around the world, teaching people about what I learn everyday.

I am an AWS Cloud Practitioner 

I love learning 💞️

🌱 I’m currently learning Python
